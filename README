SerenityOS
============

Serenity OS is a hobbyist operating system project inspired by the educational
material provided by the "Writing an OS in Rust" series by Philipp Oppermann
(https://os.phil-opp.com/). It aims to provide a platform for learning about
operating system development while also serving as a playground for
experimenting with various OS concepts and design ideas.
